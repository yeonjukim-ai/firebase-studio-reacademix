# Git & Comment Rules (200)

## 1. Commenting New Code

1. For every new file, component, or major function, add a short one-line comment at the top describing its purpose.
   - (Write your own description based on the actual feature you’re implementing)

2. Comments should be:
   - Short and clear
   - Focused on why and what the code is doing

3. If behavior changes, update the comment accordingly.

---

## 2. Preserving Existing Comments

1. Never delete existing comments without a reason.
2. If a comment is outdated or incorrect, rewrite it so it matches the updated logic.
3. For complex logic, ensure at least one clarifying comment exists.

## 3. Git Commit Message Rules

1. Use clear, imperative commit messages.
   - Examples:
     - `feat: add login form`
     - `fix: resolve button color mismatch`
     - `docs: update README`

2. Always include the related issue number.
   - `(Ref #3)` 또는 `(Ref #12)` 등

3. When a commit or PR completes an issue, mark it clearly:
   - `Closes #3`
   - `Fixes #12`

---

## 4. Branch Naming

1. Use short, meaningful branch names.
   - `feature/login-ui-3`
   - `fix/navbar-layout-8`

2. Use lowercase and hyphens (`-`) between words.

These rules apply to all future Git workflows and code comments in this project.
