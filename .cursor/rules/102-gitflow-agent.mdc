# Git CLI Usage for Git Flow
- Use `git status` and `git diff` to review changes
- Stage using `git add -p` for atomic commits, and avoid unrelated mixed commits
- Commit with Conventional Commits style (Descriptive commit messages)
- Commit title format: `[<category name for changes>] <message>`
- One purpose per commit(atomic-commit), avoiding mixed intent changes or not compilable commit point

# Branch and Remote Repository
- Check current branch matches change intent (release/, feat/, fix/, doc/, etc)
- If not matched, create a proper branch with proper prefix (release/, feat/, fix/, doc/, etc)
- One purpose per branch, avoiding many module changes per branch
- Push to remote via `git push -u origin <branch>`
- Verify GitHub credential via `git ls-remote`; prompt if missing
- After branch push, create draft PR to `main` with `gh pr create --draft`
