# Tools & Scripts Management Guidelines:

## Categories:
- Build scripts
- Deployment utilities
- Automation tools
- Temporary helpers

## Organization Rules:
- Group scripts by purpose (build, deploy, utility).
- Prefix experimental scripts with `temp_`.
- Ensure each script has usage instructions as comments.

## Maintenance:
- Regularly review and clean up obsolete scripts.
- Document dependencies if external tools are required.
