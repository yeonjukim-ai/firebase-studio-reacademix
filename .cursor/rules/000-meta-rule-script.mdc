# META RULES: UNIVERSAL PROJECT PRINCIPLES

## 1. Project Structure and Organization
- Maintain clear hierarchical organization of rules and documentation.
- Separate concerns into logical domains (Core, Workflow, Patterns).
- **Security Isolation:** Enforce strict logical/physical separation of user data (Workspace-based).

## 2. Development Philosophy
- **Value-Driven:** Every feature must contribute to reducing the user's Time-to-Value (TTV).
- **Reliability First:** Financial calculations must be deterministic and accurate (Rule-based Engine).
- **Scalable Architecture:** Design for potential transition from SaaS to On-premise/Private Cloud.

## 3. Problem-Solving Methodology
- Define problems clearly before attempting solutions.
- Analyze context and scope thoroughly.
- **Fail-Safe Design:** Anticipate invalid user inputs (especially in financials) and guide correction.

## 4. Quality Assurance
- **Zero-Tolerance for Logic Errors:** Financial models and consistency checks must be rigorously tested.
- **Performance Constraints:** Adhere to p95 < 800ms for Wizard transitions.
- Security-first approach: AES-256 encryption for sensitive fields.

## 5. Collaboration and Communication
- Clear documentation of decisions and changes.
- Standardized processes for team collaboration.
- Version control best practices with atomic commits.

## 6. Technical Excellence
- **Tech Stack Adherence:** Strict compliance with defined stack (Java/Spring, Python/FastAPI, React).
- **Clean Code:** Focus on readability and maintainability for complex logic engines.
- API-First design for all service interactions.

## 7. Project Lifecycle Management
- Clear definition of project phases (MVP vs Post-MVP).
- Systematic error handling and debugging.
- Continuous improvement processes.

## 8. Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Decouple AI drafting (LLM) from Financial Engine (Deterministic).
- Design for scalability and maintainability.
- Implement proper error handling and recovery.

## 9. Code Quality Standards
- Follow consistent naming conventions.
- Write meaningful comments and documentation.
- Focus on code readability and maintainability.

## 10. Performance and Optimization
- Optimize for low latency in interactive Wizard steps.
- Manage LLM token usage efficiently (Cost/Performance balance).

## Implementation Guidelines
- Apply these principles consistently across all project phases.
- Adapt specific implementations based on project requirements.
- Maintain flexibility while adhering to core principles.
