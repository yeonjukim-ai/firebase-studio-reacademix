# Project Overview (000)

## 1. Context

This repository is used in the **“AI 활용 서비스 기획 & 개발 전문가 과정”** to practice:

- Rapid prototyping of web UIs with AI agents (Cursor, etc.)
- Refactoring AI-generated prototypes into readable, maintainable code
- Applying Git + GitHub issue–driven development in a realistic workflow

The project is primarily a **frontend practice project**, not a full production system.

---

## 2. Goal of this project

The main goals of this project are:

1. Turn the initial prototype UI into a more stable and clean implementation.
2. Improve UX and code quality step-by-step while preserving existing behavior as much as possible.
3. Provide a small but realistic base for experimenting with:
   - Cursor Rules
   - AI-assisted coding
   - GitHub Issues / Projects / PR workflows

If new features are added, they should stay small, focused, and consistent with the current UI and architecture.

---

## 3. Target users

Conceptually, this project targets:

- Planners, PMs, and developers in the **교육 / 에듀테크 / 웹 서비스** domain
- Students of the “AI 활용 서비스 기획 & 개발 전문가 과정” who need:
  - A sandbox to test AI-assisted coding
  - A concrete example of how to structure a frontend project

The repository itself is mainly for **internal learning and experimentation**, not public end-users.

## 4. Tech stack and priorities

**Primary stack**

- React (SPA framework)
- Vite or Next.js as the build/runtime toolkit (depending on the initial template)
- JavaScript or TypeScript (TypeScript optional)
- CSS framework or design system used in the prototype (e.g., TailwindCSS, basic CSS modules, or similar)

**Priorities**

1. **Clarity over cleverness**  
   Prefer simple, explicit solutions over overly abstract or “smart” code.

2. **Small, incremental changes**  
   Avoid large rewrites. Improve the existing structure step by step.

3. **Good developer experience**  
   - Clear folder structure  
   - Helpful comments  
   - Easy local setup (minimal steps to run)

---

## 5. Non-goals

The following are *not* goals of this repository:

- Building a fully polished commercial product
- Handling extreme scale or edge-case performance
- Implementing complex backend logic inside this frontend project

These can be explored in separate repositories if needed.

## 6. How rules in this folder are used

The `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files define project-specific rules for AI agents in Cursor.

- **000–099**: Project overview and meta-rules (this file).
- **100–199**: Error handling, debugging, and build/run rules.
- **200–299**: Git workflow, commit messages, branching, and comment style.
- **300–399**: Stack-specific rules (e.g., React, Vite, styling conventions, testing).

AI agents should:

1. Read and respect this file before applying more specific rules.
2. Combine these rules with the other `.mdc` files to guide all coding and refactoring tasks.
3. Keep new rules consistent with the structure described above.

This file defines the high-level intent of the project and should be updated if the project’s scope or stack changes.
