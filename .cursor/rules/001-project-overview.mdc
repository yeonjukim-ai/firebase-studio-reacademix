# PROJECT OVERVIEW: AI Co-Pilot for First-time Founders

## Vision
Transform the complex business planning process into a data-driven decision-making journey that reduces failure rates. Act as an intelligent partner to help founders quickly pass funding gates (government grants, loans) and focus on sustainable growth.

## Core Features
- **Submission Wizard:** Step-by-step guide for government/bank forms (100% template compatibility).
- **Financial Auto-Engine:** Generates 3-year P&L and cash flow from key variables.
- **AI Drafting:** Context-aware writing assistance with Easy/Expert modes.
- **PMF Diagnostic:** Analyzes product-market fit and risks based on standard frameworks.
- **Docs Export:** One-click HWP/PDF export fully compliant with submission standards.

## Target Audience
- **First-time Founders:** Non-technical, struggling with business logic and jargon.
- **Small Business Owners:** Need bank loans but lack financial modeling expertise.
- **Serial Entrepreneurs:** Seek to verify PMF and unit economics before scaling.

## Project Goals
- **Pass Funding Gates:** Maximize acceptance rates for grants and loans.
- **Minimize Prep Time:** Drastically reduce time spent on documentation.
- **Logic Validation:** Detect and fix inconsistencies between narrative and financials.

## Success Metrics (North Star: TTV)
- **Time-to-Value (TTV):** < 30 mins to first "submit-ready" draft.
- **Activation Rate:** > 40% of users complete a draft in first session.
- **Pass Rate:** > 65% acceptance for submitted proposals.

## Project Philosophy
- **Failure Avoidance:** Prioritize risk detection over just "generating text".
- **Logic > Rhetoric:** Ensure financial numbers back up the qualitative claims.
- **Security First:** Absolute protection of sensitive business ideas and financial data.
