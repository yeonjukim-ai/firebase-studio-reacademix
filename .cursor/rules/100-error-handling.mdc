# Error Handling Rules (100)

When fixing any error in this project, follow these rules:

1. **Write a Root-Cause Hypothesis First**
   - Before producing any code changes, write 2–3 short paragraphs.
   - Paragraphs must include:
     - What is likely causing the error
     - What evidence or file paths support this guess
     - What you plan to verify or modify

2. **Propose Minimal and Targeted Fixes**
   - Prefer *small, surgical changes* over rewriting entire files.
   - Preserve existing logic whenever possible.
   - Modify only the parts necessary to resolve the issue.

3. **Show Before/After Code Blocks**
   - Provide the code snippet that is being changed.
   - Then provide the updated version below it.
   - Highlight what changed.

4. **Never Remove Existing Comments**
   - If a comment is wrong, update it instead of deleting it.

5. **Always Explain Why the Fix Works**
   - 2–4 sentences describing why the modification resolves the issue.

This rule applies to all error fixes initiated within this project.
